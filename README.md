In this article, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process of how to delete your Cash App account. Let's dive in.

What is Cash App?
If you're reading this article, chances are you're already familiar with Cash App, but let's quickly cover the basics just in case. Cash App is a mobile payment service that allows users to transfer money to one another using a mobile phone app.

Cash App has become increasingly popular due to its user-friendly interface and wide range of features for mobile devices. However, with so much personal and financial information tied to your account, it's crucial to follow the proper steps when you're ready to delete it.

Deleting the Cash App from your phone is not enough. When you simply uninstall the app, your account and data remain active on Cash App's servers. This means your financial information could still be vulnerable, and you may continue to be charged for any subscriptions or services linked to your profile.

To fully close your account and protect your data, you'll need to go through the official account deletion process, which we'll detail in the next section.

Prerequisites Before Deleting Your Cash App Account
Before you begin the account deletion process, you should take a few important steps to ensure you don't lose access to your cash balance or disrupt any active subscriptions. Let's go through each of these prerequisites one by one.

Transfer Any Remaining Balance
If you have any Cash App funds left in your account, you'll need to transfer them to an active bank account before deleting your account. Here's how:

Open the Cash App on your iPhone or Android device
Tap the "Balance" tab on the home screen
Press "Cash Out" and withdraw your total balance
Select a deposit speed (Instant or Standard) and confirm with your PIN or Touch ID to transfer the remaining Cash App money to your linked bank.
If you have Bitcoin or stocks in your account, you'll need to sell them by following a similar procedure.

To sell Bitcoin, tap the "Bitcoin" tab on the home screen, press "Sell," choose an amount, and confirm with your PIN or Touch ID
To sell stocks, tap the "Investing" tab, select the company whose stock you want to sell, press "Sell," choose the number of shares you want to sell, and confirm with your PIN or Touch ID
Review Account for Unfinished Transactions
Before closing your account, ensure you have no pending or incomplete transactions. If you do, either cancel them (if possible) or wait for them to complete before proceeding with account deletion.

Go to your Cash App payment history and check for any pending payments, requests, or transfers. If you see any unfinished transactions that can't be canceled, it's best to wait a few days for them to fully process before deleting your account.

Update Subscriptions or Automatic Payments
Review your Cash App payment history for active subscriptions and automatic payments. For each one, either cancel the subscription altogether or update it with a different payment method, such as a credit card or another mobile payment service. Otherwise, those charges will fail once your Cash App balance is removed and your account is closed.

Once you've completed these prerequisites, you're ready to proceed with deleting your Cash App account.

Download Your Information
Before you close your Cash App account, you may want to download your account information and transaction history for your records or tax purposes. Here's how:

Log in to your Cash App account on a web browser (you can't currently download your information from the app)
Click "Statements" in the top-right corner
Select a date range for the information you want to download
Click "Export CSV" to download a spreadsheet of your transactions
Remember, you won't be able to access this information once your account is deleted, so make sure to download it beforehand if you think you might need it.

Step-by-Step Guide: How to Delete Your Cash App Account
Now that you've completed the necessary prerequisites, you're ready to permanently delete your Cash App account. Follow these steps:

Open the Cash App on your iPhone or Android device
Tap the profile icon in the top-right corner of your screen
Scroll down and tap "Support"
On the next screen, scroll down to the "Account Settings" section and tap "Something Else"
From the list of options, select "Account Settings"
Tap "Close Account"
On the next screen, tap "Close My Cash App Account"
Read through the account closure information, then scroll to the bottom and tap "Confirm Closing Account"
After completing these steps, your Cash App account will be permanently closed. You should receive a confirmation email or text within a few minutes.

What Happens When You Delete Your Cash App Account?
When you delete your Cash App account:

Your account is permanently closed and cannot be reopened
Your $Cashtag (unique username) is released and can be claimed by another Cash App user
Any scheduled transactions or pending payments are canceled
Your transaction history and account information are deleted from Cash App's servers
If someone tries to send you money after your account is deleted, they'll receive an error message stating that your $Cashtag doesn't exist.

Remember that while Cash App deletes your data from their servers, they may retain some information as required by law or for legal purposes. You can read more about how Cash App handles your data in their Privacy Policy.

Alternatives to Cash App
If you're deleting your Cash App account because it no longer meets your needs, perhaps due to needing a high volume merchant account, you may wonder what other mobile payment services are available. Here are a few popular alternatives:

Venmo: Owned by PayPal, Venmo is a user-friendly app that allows you to send and receive money, split expenses, and make purchases at select merchants.
